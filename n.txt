Here's a suggested speech for a career day presentation on computer programming:

---

Good morning/afternoon everyone,

I'm excited to be here today to talk about my field, computer programming. As a programmer, I get to create technology solutions that impact people's lives.

Have you ever wondered how your favorite app or game works? Or how websites like Facebook, Instagram, or Google were built? It's all thanks to computer programming.

Programming is not just about writing code; it's about solving problems, being creative, and working with others. As programmers, we use languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript to bring ideas to life.

There are many types of programmers, from software engineers to web developers, mobile app developers, and data scientists. You can specialize in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, or cybersecurity.

To become a programmer, you'll need skills like problem-solving, logical thinking, and attention to detail. You'll also need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools.

The job outlook for programmers is excellent, with high demand and good salaries. Plus, programming skills are useful in many industries, from healthcare to finance, education, and gaming.

If you're interested in programming, don't worry if you don't know where to start. There are many online resources, courses, and certifications available. You can even join coding clubs or attend hackathons.

As programmers, we have the power to create technology that makes a difference. We can build apps that help people communicate, websites that provide vital information, or games that bring joy.

So, if you're curious about programming, I encourage you to explore this field. Who knows, maybe one day you'll create the next big thing!

Thank you for listening, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
